[A] UPDATE TO GENERAL DESIGN STRUCTURE

1. Layout Update:
  (a) SHIFT LAYOUT CONTAINER: As predicted, we need to shift the container out of layout, into each of the components.  To keep the "container#main" consistent, we have attached an id to it & select it in global CSS.  We then have wrapped each view component within this container id=main.

  (b) LAYOUT MODIFIES "ContentWrap": Replaced the container with a styled component called "ContentWrap" which will feed into the new flex box structure (to ensure the footer sits flush at the bottom of a full window)

  (c) NEW - APP LAYOUT DIV in App.js: This allows us to complete our flex box structure (again, selected and modified in global CSS)

  (d) NEW - GLOBAL COLOURS: To create design consistency, we have created colour variables attributed to the root file, which will allow us to call them and keep colours consistent across the application

2. Changes to Home & Navbar:
  (a) HOME - POSITION IS NOW "RELATIVE" not FIXED: This is to ensure the footer always sits below it in our flex structure (otherwise it overlaps due to it forming part of the viewport)

  (b) NAVBAR - FIXED TOP: Using Bootstrap naming, we designate Navbar as fixed="top" to always have following the scroll

  (c) NEW - ABOUT PAGE: Added About page to round out the application (particularly for the Footer)
