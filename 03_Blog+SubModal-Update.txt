[B] UPDATE TO BLOG PAGE
- Created a blog page using the standard Bootstrap grid rather than Bootstrap cards - too allow for more customisation 
- Has some nice hover animations that improve the user experience

CURRENTLY: Styled largely using Bootstrap classes, global CSS properties & global CSS variables

PLAN FOR UPDATE: 
- Transition the component-level CSS in the global CSS stylesheet into the componenet using styled-components
- Improve the CSS as there are lots of !important & duplicate CSS entries
- Fix the "like" icon which doesnt have a working focus/hover


[C] UPDATE TO SUBMODAL DESIGN 
- Used the React-Icons Context API to size and colour the icon (see: https://github.com/react-icons/react-icons#configuration)
- Used Bootstrap style properties to clean up the Modal formatting
- Used styled-components to customise the h5 & p text as needed
